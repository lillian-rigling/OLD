# Hello!
![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

I'm Lillian Hogendoorn (n√©e Rigling) and I'm a trained librarian with a passion for universal design and equitable access. I currently work as the Curator of Digital Experience at the University of Toronto Libraries, where I provide strategic management of the libraries' web spaces to help users to connect with our services, resources, people and libraries. I earned my Master of Information in Library and Information Science at the University of Toronto Faculty of Information in 2016. 

My research and practice centres on the intersection of Open with critical issues, such as privacy, information privilege, and accessibility. This website is an evolving representation of my experience, my practice, and my thoughts. If you have questions, comments, or just want to chat, please reach out via email (lillian.hogendoorn @ gmail .com) or on Twitter at [@l_hogendoorn](https://twitter.com/l_hogendoorn). 

*I live and work on the unceded territory of the Anishinabewaki, Huron-Wendat, and Haudenosauneega peoples.*
