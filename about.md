# Hello!
![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

I'm Lillian Hogendoorn (née Rigling) and I'm a trained Scholarly Communication and Copyright Librarian with a passion for Open Education and Open Scholarship. I currently work as the Digital Access and OER Lead at eCampusOntario, supporting open and technology-enabled learning at Ontario’s 45 colleges and universities. Previously, I worked as a Research and Scholarly Communications Librarian at Western University Libraries, and as a cross-appointed Librarian/Fellow at North Carolina State University Libraries in the Copyright & Digital Scholarship Center and User Experience Department. I earned my Master of Information in Library and Information Science at the University of Toronto Faculty of Information in 2016. 

My research and practice centres on the intersection of Open with critical issues, such as privacy, information privilege, and accessibility. This website is an evolving representation of my experience, my practice, and my thoughts. If you have questions, comments, or just want to chat, please reach out via email (lillian.hogendoorn @ gmail .com) or on Twitter at [@l_hogendoorn](https://twitter.com/l_hogendoorn). 

*I live and work on the unceded territory of the Anishinabewaki, Huron-Wendat, and Haudenosauneega peoples.*

Also, I built this OER Calculator!
